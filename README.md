# CollabSphere Backend

This is the backend service for CollabSphere, a collaborative platform. The service is built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, following a Clean Architecture pattern.

## Features

-   **User Registration:** New users can register, which also creates a new organization.
-   **Clean Architecture:** The codebase is structured into `core` (domain logic), `infrastructure` (frameworks, databases), and `application` layers.
-   **TypeScript:** Fully typed codebase for better maintainability and developer experience.
-   **MongoDB:** Uses Mongoose for object data modeling with MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.20.1 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (A running instance, local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/ExpressWithRongRath.git](https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/ExpressWithRongRath.git)
cd ExpressWithRongRath
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables.

```env
# The port the server will run on
PORT=3000

# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Replace the `MONGO_URI` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

### 4. Running the Application

-   **Development Mode:**
    This command uses `nodemon` and `ts-node` to automatically restart the server on file changes.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

-   **Production Mode:**
    This first builds the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the `dist/` directory and then starts the server.

    ```bash
    # Step 1: Build the project
    npm run build

    # Step 2: Start the server
    npm start
    ```

The server will start, and you should see the following message in your console:
`ðŸš€ Server is running on port 3000`

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

### Health Check
